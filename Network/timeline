need to send the state of environment to player
need to receive the actions from player ->
    process on server, RPC to aware client


server has peers, a peer should have a ServerPlayer object
on active and spawn we create a ServerPlayer?
ServerPlayer is kept on the server side.
Player is kept on client side?
Player presses forwards axis, send  to Server which processes. we RPC "press forwards" to aware clients (including the actioning palyer)
Key release follows same process.

When a client receives a RPC it takes the LOCAL DB?

So when a client joins and receives an update of the world state relevant to it, hold onto that data in memory.
Game.Context contains the data.
an object wants a RPC. it will have a UID.
IF the client context is aware then perform the RPC.
    IF the client is not yet aware then instantiate a copy of the object. storing in memory.
    Call "Object:Spawn()" and fill its attributes.
